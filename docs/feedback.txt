Ideas for improvement:
Add a Share button, so people can share their stats on social media
Lower the years a bit. The current years are quite far into the future, like 100 years.
Add the users nickname, so they have it as a certificate of their prediciton.
Add questions regarding the ever growing datacenters and the consequence on electricity prices.
Survey about what background knowledge people have about AI: eg have you tried red teaming system prompts, have you fine tuned a LLM, have you used an uncensored LLM, have you used CNNs, have you used RNNs, genetic algorithms, cellular automata, etc.
More people to compare with such as: Nick Bostrom, Eric Smidth, Rob Miles.
