Okay, let's break down the Python script's user flow and create text-based wireframes for a potential web interface, along with prompts for a designer/developer.

**Core User Flow Analysis:**

1.  **Start:** User lands on the page.
2.  **Initial View:** Show introductory text and the *initial* P(doom) estimate based on default priors.
3.  **Quiz Loop:**
    *   Present a question with multiple-choice answers.
    *   User selects an answer and submits.
    *   (Script internally updates evidence and recalculates probabilities).
    *   Show the *updated* P(doom) estimate (intermediate feedback - the script shows the full distribution and High+VH% point estimate).
    *   Present the next question.
    *   (Repeat for all questions, potentially grouped by 'Level').
4.  **Final View:** After the last question, display the final P(doom) range (Low, Central, High estimates based on sensitivity analysis), compare the central estimate to expert data, and show concluding remarks/disclaimers.

#          AI Risk Assessment (by 2035) - Web UI          #
###########################################################

[ Page Title: AI Risk Assessment (Target 2035) ]

[ Section: Introduction ]
Welcome! This tool uses a simplified Bayesian Network simulation
to estimate the probability of AI-related existential catastrophe
(P(doom)) by the year 2035, based on your answers to key questions.

NOTE: The underlying probabilities used in the model are illustrative
and intended for demonstration. The final result will be presented
as a range based on a simplified sensitivity analysis.

[ Section: Initial Estimate (Based on Default Priors) ]
Before you begin, here is the model's initial estimate:

  Initial P(doom by 2035) Distribution (Approximate Ranges):
    * P(Doom=Low)      = [ Initial Low Range % ]   (e.g., 20% - 30%)
    * P(Doom=Medium)   = [ Initial Med Range % ]   (e.g., 35% - 45%)
    * P(Doom=High)     = [ Initial High Range % ]  (e.g., 15% - 25%)
    * P(Doom=VeryHigh) = [ Initial VH Range % ]    (e.g., 5% - 15%)

  Initial P(Doom=High or VeryHigh): [ Initial High+VH Point Estimate ]%

[ Call to Action ]
Please answer the following questions to refine the estimate based
on your own judgments.

[ Button: Start Quiz / Next Question ]
```

**Prompt for Wireframe 1:**

*   **Goal:** Create the landing/initial screen for the AI Risk Assessment tool.
*   **Content:**
    *   Clear title indicating the topic and target year (2035).
    *   Brief introductory text explaining the tool's purpose and the illustrative nature of the underlying model.
    *   Display the *initial* P(doom) probability distribution (Low, Medium, High, VeryHigh states) using the approximate percentage ranges generated by `format_prob_range` (or similar web-friendly display).
    *   Display the initial point estimate for P(Doom=High or VeryHigh).
    *   Include a clear button to start the quiz.
*   **Interaction:** The user reads the intro and initial estimate, then clicks the "Start Quiz" button to proceed to the first question. Data displayed is static based on the script's initial run with no evidence.

  (...) [ Add options dynamically based on QID ]

  ( Special note for Q15 if needed: "This reflects your baseline intuition..." )

[ Button: Submit Answer & View Update / Next Question ]
```

**Prompt for Wireframe 2:**

*   **Goal:** Design the main interaction screen where users answer questions. This screen updates dynamically for each question.
*   **Content:**
    *   Indicate progress (e.g., "Question 3 of 14").
    *   Display the *current* P(doom = High or VeryHigh) point estimate (central model) based on answers given so far. (This acts as intermediate feedback).
    *   Optionally, display the full current distribution breakdown using approximate ranges.
    *   Show the current Question Level (from `questions_map`).
    *   Display the Question ID (`QID`) and the full Question Text.
    *   Present the multiple-choice options associated with the current question, using radio buttons for single selection.
    *   *Special Handling:* If the question is Q15 ('is_prior_belief'), display the text normally but perhaps add a small note clarifying its purpose (as the script does). The backend will know not to treat it as direct evidence in the same way.
*   **Interaction:**
    *   User reads the current estimate and the question.
    *   User selects one radio button option.
    *   User clicks the "Submit Answer" button.
    *   The application should then:
        1.  Record the user's choice mapped to the specific node and state.
        2.  Trigger the backend calculation (`update_all_probabilities_manual` with current evidence).
        3.  Refresh this *same* wireframe structure with the *next* question's details and the *newly updated* "Current Estimate" section based on the answer just submitted.

**Wireframe 3: Final Results & Comparison**

#          AI Risk Assessment - Final Results             #
###########################################################

[ Section: Summary ]
Thank you for completing the assessment. Based on your answers,
the model estimates the following range for P(doom by 2035).

[ Section: Final P(doom by 2035) Estimate Range ]
This range reflects a sensitivity analysis by adjusting the final
P(doom) calculation (+/- [ Perturbation Delta ]% points):

  * Lower Bound (Optimistic Sensitivity):   [ Final Lower Bound ] %
  * Central Estimate:                     [ Final Central Estimate ] %
  * Upper Bound (Pessimistic Sensitivity):  [ Final Upper Bound ] %

  --> Suggested plausible range for P(Doom=High or VeryHigh): [ Final Lower Bound ]% - [ Final Upper Bound ]%

[ Section: Detailed Central Distribution (Optional but Good) ]
  Central Estimate Breakdown (Approx Ranges):
    * P(Doom=Low)      = [ Final Central Low Range % ]
    * P(Doom=Medium)   = [ Final Central Med Range % ]
    * P(Doom=High)     = [ Final Central High Range % ]
    * P(Doom=VeryHigh) = [ Final Central VH Range % ]

[ Section: Comparison to Experts ]
Comparing your CENTRAL estimate ([ Final Central Estimate ]%) to available 2035 expert estimates:

  * [ Display closest expert name and their estimate: "Closest to: Expert Name (~XX%)" ]
  * OR [ Display message if no experts found/no 2035 data: "Could not load expert data / No comparable 2035 estimates found." ]

[ Section: Important Notes & Disclaimers ]
  * Reminder: The range shown results from a simplified sensitivity analysis on the final P(doom) node's probabilities.
  * It gives a sense of sensitivity but is NOT a formal confidence interval.
  * The accuracy depends heavily on the simplified model structure and the illustrative calibration of ALL probabilities, especially for the 2035 timeframe.

[ Button: Start Over / Try Again ]
```

**Prompt for Wireframe 3:**

*   **Goal:** Create the final results screen displayed after the user answers all questions.
*   **Content:**
    *   A clear title indicating these are the final results.
    *   A summary statement.
    *   Display the final calculated P(doom = High or VeryHigh) range: Lower Bound, Central Estimate, and Upper Bound percentages. Clearly state the final plausible range derived from these bounds. Mention the perturbation delta used for the sensitivity analysis.
    *   (Optional but Recommended): Show the breakdown of the *central* estimate distribution (Low, Med, High, VH) using approximate ranges.
    *   Display the comparison to the closest expert based on the user's *central* estimate, including the expert's name and their approximate 2035 percentage. Handle cases where expert data is unavailable or lacks 2035 estimates gracefully.
    *   Include the important notes and disclaimers from the end of the script regarding the limitations of the model and the sensitivity analysis.
    *   Provide a button to restart the assessment.
*   **Interaction:** User reviews their final results and the comparison. They can choose to start the quiz over. Data displayed is calculated after the last question is answered, incorporating all user evidence and running the central, optimistic, and pessimistic final calculations.
